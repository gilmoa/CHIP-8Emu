# CHIP-8Emu
My test at writing an emulator.

***

## TODOs
 1. `Beep()` still confusing.
 2. Input might still need fixing.
 3. `0xDXYN` looks like shit and might not be working as intended.
 4. `DrawScreen()` works fine but might need a review.

***

## Tested
The emulator has been tested with the following ROMs from [David Winter](http://www.pong-story.com/chip8/):
> * 15PUZZLE
> * BLINKY
> * BLITZ
> * BREAKOUT
> * BRIX
> * CONNECT4
> * GUESS `*`
> * HIDDEN `*`
> * INVADERS
> * KALEID

`*` = Speed is off, game running too fast.
