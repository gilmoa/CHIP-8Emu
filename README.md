# CHIP-8Emu
My test at writing an emulator.

***

## TODOs
 1. `Beep()` still confusing.
 2. `Thread.Sleep()` needs to be replaced by proper time based delay.
 3. Input might still need fixing.
 4. `0xDXYN` looks like shit and might not be working as intended.
 5. `DrawScreen()` works fine but might need a review.

## Tested
The emulator has been tested with the following ROMs from [David Winter](http://www.pong-story.com/chip8/):
> * 15PUZZLE

> * BLITZ
> * BREAKOUT
